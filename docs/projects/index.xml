      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was gifted a &amp;ldquo;Question a Day&amp;rdquo; journal. The idea is simple: you answer one question every day, and a year later, you return to the same questions. It’s a beautiful way to track how you evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I loved the concept, keeping up with it was a struggle. I traveled a lot, and the book was quite heavy to carry around. I tried searching for a digital alternative, but nothing felt right. I wanted something simple—no forced registrations, no data tracking, and all the essential features available for free. Apparently, that was a big ask, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a single app that fit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
