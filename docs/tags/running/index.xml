      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, Yura and I were walking through a mall, and I spotted an Onitsuka Tiger store. Just a few weeks ago, I would have walked right past it without a second thought. But now, I know exactly what that store represents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Shoe Dog—the memoir by the creator of Nike, Phil Knight. In it, he shares the story of how he built the company, the obstacles he faced, and how Nike barely kept its head above water for years—even while making millions. It’s a raw look at what he had to sacrifice to make the brand a success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
